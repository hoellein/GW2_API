// PvE
// There are more returned from the API than displayed in-game
// Same list appears in-game for L80 char and L02 char, HoT access is enabled
// It appears to work like this:
//  1. Check required_access
//      filter out HoT or base specific (HoT supersedes base)
//  2. Check account level (not toon level)
//      L80 account, filter lower max level
//      <L80 account, filter on range
// Vista - Level 80 char with HoT
